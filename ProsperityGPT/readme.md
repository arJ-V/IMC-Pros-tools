# Essentially ChatGPT for Propserity

I trained GPT 5.2 (and hopefully later GPT models) to essentially streamline the process from algo theory to development. 


## Training

The GPT wrapper is trained on a few different domains. If you have the time I would recommend you ask ProsperityGPT what exactly its trained on to get an accurate idea but essentially my goal was to distill a strong foundation in the IMC Prosperity trading structure/convention, leverage quant finance theory through literature/textbooks, and polish it with winning traits (past winner intuitions, reasonings, algos).


## Usage

Usage is directly through the chat gpt website: [link](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-682c8d8303c48191bc8889ce6a5b58f2-prosperitygpt). Unfortunately I do not think there is any api for custom GPTs yet so you can't use it with IDEs like cursor but maybe in the future :).
