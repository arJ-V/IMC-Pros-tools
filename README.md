# IMC-Pros-tools

IMC Prosperity tools. What I've found to be useful during rounds and in off-season testing/learning.

## Already Great Tools
[Jmerle](https://github.com/jmerle) is an incredible resource for getting started in IMC algo development. If you don't use anything else I would highly recommend their repos:

- **Backtester**  
  Backtest your algo locally on data from IMC. [Link](https://github.com/jmerle/imc-prosperity-3-backtester)
- **Visualizer**  
  Visualizer for pnl, order book, etc. [Link](https://github.com/jmerle/imc-prosperity-visualizer)
- **cl-submitter**
  CL submitter for IMC website. [Link](https://github.com/jmerle/imc-prosperity-3-submitter)
