# IMC-Pros-tools

IMC Prosperity tools. What I've found to be useful during rounds and in off-season testing/learning.

## Already Great Tools
[Jmerle](https://github.com/jmerle) is an incredible resource for getting started in IMC algo development. If you don't use anything else I would highly recommend their repos:

- **Backtester**  
  Backtest your algo locally on data from IMC. [Link](https://github.com/jmerle/imc-prosperity-3-backtester)
- **Visualizer**  
  Visualizer for pnl, order book, etc. [Link](https://github.com/jmerle/imc-prosperity-visualizer)
- **cl-submitter**
  CL submitter for IMC website. [Link](https://github.com/jmerle/imc-prosperity-3-submitter)

## More Tools

**ProsperityGPT**
- GPT trained on high-competitors and quantitative finance literature, learn more about construction in the [readme.](https://github.com/arJ-V/IMC-Pros-tools/blob/main/ProsperityGPT/readme.md). (folder of ProsperityGPT in this repo)
- [Link to GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-682c8d8303c48191bc8889ce6a5b58f2-prosperitygpt)

**imc-Prospector**
- yes im giving them all corny names. cl + algo checker. loved using jmerle's cl submitter but wanted functionality to check for any stupid errors before submitting to prosperity and waiting a bunch for a error response. So... thats what this is. check out the repo: [link](https://github.com/arJ-V/imc-prospector), or the pypi package: [link](https://pypi.org/project/imc-prospector/#description)
